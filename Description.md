Welcome to JaMoveo!
App Goal - to let people the ability to have joined virtual rehersal.
JaMoveo is an application that allows users to log in from their phones and register as a user or as an admin, specifying which instrument they play. 
An admin user can create a rehearsal session, and during the session, everyone will be able to connect to the rehearsal.
App flow:
When a user enters the application and logs in, their screen will display "Waiting for a song" until the admin starts a rehearsal.
How does the admin start a rehearsal? After logging in, the admin enters a song/artist search page. 
After searching for a song or an artist, the admin is shown a page with all relevant results, including the song title, artist name, and an image. 
The admin can then select a song from the list. 
Once a song is selected, both the admin and all connected users will be redirected to a page displaying the songâ€™s lyrics and chords. 
If the user is a singer, he will see only the lyrics without the chords.
On the rehearsal page, each user has a scroll button that moves the screen down for easy viewing,
In addition, the font size and colors are bold and optimized for user convenience, allowing users to read clearly, even in low visibility.
The admin also has a "Quit" button, which, when clicked, ends the rehearsal for all users and redirects everyone back to their main page.
